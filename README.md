# Hello, World! I'm Meg.  
### Welcome to my Work in Progress.  

Right now, I'm polishing my GitHub profile, improving my commit messages, and organizing my website project repo. I’m also brainstorming ideas for my new professional landing page and digital business card at **[meganfrench.info](https://meganfrench.info)**.  

I’m currently building a clean, STEM-focused social presence centered on academic and technical work. This persona is separate from my creative performance art project and fictional character, **girl ben Elohim**, which serves as a philosophy and art-driven mythos that inspires and adds nuance and spiritual context to the scientific work of **Megan French**, the real living researcher.  

**Megan French (real person)** → `@girlcoded1011110` or `@girlc0d3d`  
**girl ben Elohim (fictional)** → `@prozacncheese`  
**GitHub username:** `unwellbutrin` → links directly to [meganfrench.info](https://meganfrench.info), my polished and professional hub for collaborators, mentors, and future employers.  

It connects my GitHub, my digital lab journal **[meganfrench.tech](https://meganfrench.tech)**, my LinkedIn, and any future platforms I integrate.  

**DBA:** *PINK PILLED* — the umbrella under which all my digital work is housed, across all aliases.

##  My Goals  

I want to develop a pathway into **freelance scientific journalism** while pursuing my **computer science degree**. Writing about STEM and open-source work serves as both a creative outlet and a professional practice for skill development and portfolio growth.  

### Over the next four months, I plan to:
- Polish my GitHub and contribute consistently (3–5 commits per day, with up to 7 rest days per month).  
- Build proficiency in **Python**, **Linux**, and general **system administration**.  
- Learn to work effectively across **Linux distributions** and understand their use cases.  
- Upgrade my hardware (ideally a laptop with an **NVIDIA Blackwell GPU**, **1TB SSD**, and **plenty of RAM**) to support heavier bioinformatics workflows.

##  Next Steps  

- Develop a deep understanding of open-source contribution workflows and how to make meaningful, helpful contributions.  
  *(Currently exploring [goodfirstissues.com](https://goodfirstissues.com) and feeling a bit like a Canadian goose during a magnetic pole shift.)*  
- Build and connect my digital ecosystem — domains, DNS records, and HTML pages — all secured through **Cloudflare**.  
  *(Debugging redirect loop issues on [meganfrench.tech](https://meganfrench.tech).)*  
- Start contributing to open-source projects in **bioinformatics**.  
- Engage with open-source communities across **TikTok**, **Reddit**, **Discord**, and **YouTube**, sharing my progress and learning journey.  
- Demystify **crypto** and **decentralized social platforms** like **Farcaster** and **Odysee** to integrate them into my broader ecosystem.  
- Continuously improve in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **Linux**.  
- Expand into additional programming languages and paradigms.  
- Keep my digital scientific journal updated with coursework, projects, and published writing — blending technical documentation with creative scientific storytelling.

##  Why We Should Connect  

- You’re into **STEM**, **the arts**, or **philosophy** → we’ll vibe immediately.  
- You’re learning or teaching **HTML, CSS, or JavaScript** → I’d love to share what I’ve learned about setting up a GitHub profile and project workflow.  
- You’re working in or studying **bioinformatics or biodata analysis** → please, let me pick your brain.  
- You’re a **Computer Science major** → connect with me here or on social media; I’ll follow back!  
- You’re a **girl who codes** → seriously, reach out. I need more data sisters in my life.
